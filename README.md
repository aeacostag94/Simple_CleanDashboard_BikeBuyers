# Simple_CleanDashboard_BikeBuyers
This is a simple exercise cleaning data with Python and Panadas and visualize with Excel Dashboard
First we create a duplicate from the sheet we are going to work, this to make sure to donâ€™t mess the original data.
Second, we delete all the duplicates.
Then we parameterize the table to be able to work more easier with the data, it is mean create range for the age of the people, change de letter M for Married and S to Single for ex to create columns with more information.
In the formulas we have If statmets, we create from the center to outside.
In the pivot tables like a good practice we create specifics names for the pivot tables, so is easier when we are working with them.
We create slicers to filter the infomration in the report and conect whit all the pivto tables
We add some styles


Note: If u run the the python file, it will generate a new excel with the new dataset, and one plot just to prove the functions.
